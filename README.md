[Here's a video by Dan Warren](https://youtu.be/ypknYnfl1ps) of the BASIC original.
It seemed like an easy target:
it's a small game with lots of opportunities for improvement.
I'll be putting more stuff in it in the future.

I converted it to 6502 assembly for the Commodore 64 to learn the language.
The assembler used is [64tass](http://tass64.sourceforge.net/).
The IDE used is my own unreleased plugin for Intellij Idea: [Intellij6502](https://github.com/matozoid/Intellij6502).
CharPad and SpritePad were used for the title screen and the sprites.

Now you can look at the source code and laugh at my attempt :-D

"build.sh" builds the thing.
"run.sh" builds and runs it with [Vice](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/).
